Guidelines to run a basic map reduce program

Create a 3 node hadoop cluster using Dataproc.
Write your map reduce program using java, convert it into a jar file and upload it to the dataproc cluster.
Create a directory in HDFS (hadoop distributed file system) and upload your dataset into the directory.
Run the map reduce program on the dataset using the jar file.
Get the generated output files from hdfs and download the files.

Some useful commands and links
                                       
Link to download hadoop core jar file       
https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.hadoop/hadoop-core/1.2.1
Compile java file to produce class files         
javac -classpath hadoop-core-1.2.1.jar -d somefolder Frequency.java
Generate jar file from class files
jar -cvf Frequency.jar -C somefolder/ .
List all the contents in a directory          
ls <path>
Make a directory in hdfs
hdfs dfs -mkdir /datafolder/
Put a file from local hadoop file system to hdfs 
hdfs dfs -put dataset.txt /datafolder/
List all the contents of a directory which is in hdfs
hdfs dfs -ls <path>
Hadoop command to run map reduce program
hadoop jar <jarfile path> <package.classname> <dataset path> <output path> 
Example command to run inbuilt word count program
hadoop jar /usr/lib/hadoop-mapreduce/hadoop-mapreduce-examples.jar wordcount /datafolder/ /tmp/result/
Get a file from hdfs to local hadoop file system
hdfs dfs -get /tmp/result* /tmp/result .
Inbuilt hadoop jar files
ls /usr/lib/hadoop-mapreduce/
Get the present working directory path
pwd
Change directory
cd <path>
Upload a file from remote location using url
wget <url> 
Upload a file from your computer to hadoop local file system or download a file from hadoop local file system
Click options in right top corner of ssh terminal -> upload or download file
cmd to run
 hadoop jar Frequency.jar hadoop.Frequency /datafolder/ /tmp/result/ 
hdfs dfs -get /tmp/result* /tmp/result .
